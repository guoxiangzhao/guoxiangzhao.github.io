For only the 5th time in her 60 year reign outside her annual Christmas broadcasts, She has paid tribute to the NHS and key workers for keep good and service going amid the Coronavirus outbreaks. And said when the country succeed in overcoming it , that success will belong to us all. 


During my “daily exercise” today, a solitary early run on drizzly and deserted streets, the only people I saw (almost literally) were numerous women and men clad in high-vis... diligently at work keeping the gas, water, electricity, and data flowing. 

Despite being a civil engineer, I’ve never acutely taken notice of this before... during the daily, hectic machinations of life.

If you should happen to see them on your daily run/walk/cycle today, please consider thanking them for their essential work. We would be absolutely lost without them - now more than ever.
